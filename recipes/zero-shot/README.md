Please see [here](https://github.com/quanpn90/NMTGMinor) for its main contributors.

Create virtual environment from [environment.yml](../../environment.yml) by:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Clone this repo and switch to the branch `sim`.
```
git clone https://github.com/nlp-dke/NMTGMinor.git
git checkout sim
```

### Dependency
For training:
* Python version >= 3.7 (most recommended)
* [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) >= 1.0.1
* [apex](https://github.com/nvidia/apex) when using half- or mixed-precision training 
  
For preprocessing:
* [subword-nmt](https://github.com/rsennrich/subword-nmt)
* [sentencepiece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece)
* [indic_nlp_library](https://github.com/anoopkunchukuttan/indic_nlp_library) and [FloRes](https://github.com/facebookresearch/flores) for Indian language tokenization
* [Moses](https://github.com/moses-smt/mosesdecoder) for tokenization of languages in Latin script

For evaluation:
* [sacreBLEU](https://github.com/mjpost/sacrebleu)

### Preprocess
First source the config file:
```
source ./recipes/zero-shot/config.sh
```
Preprocess and binarize the dataset:
```
bash ./recipes/zero-shot/prepro.sh
bash ./recipes/zero-shot/binarize.sh
```

### Train
To train the baseline:
```
bash ./recipes/zero-shot/train.sh
```

To train the baseline with residual removed in the middle encoder layer:
```
bash ./recipes/zero-shot/train.remove.residual.sh
```

To train the baseline with residual removed and use position-based query, in the middle encoder layer:
```
bash ./recipes/zero-shot/train.remove.residual.query.sh
```

### Test
```
# Example with iwslt:
bash ./recipes/zero-shot/pred.iwslt.sh $MODEL_NAME 
```
`$MODEL_NAME` is directory name containing the trained model (`model.pt`).

## Data
Our experiments are run on three datasets: IWSLT 2017, Europarl, PMIndia.

### Download Preprossed Data
Below are links to download the preprocessed data. 

**Please note: The target files start with language tags, since we do not specifically add BOS tokens again. If your implementation automatically append language/BOS tags to target sentences, please make sure to remove the tags in the target files.**

### Dataset Description

#### IWSLT

The training set is a subset of the TED task from IWSLT 2017 compiled in the MMCR4NLP dataset (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.01025.pdf).

We use the dev set from multilingual TED task from IWSLT 2017 (dev2010).
https://wit3.fbk.eu/2017-01

The test set is the official test set (tst2017) for the multilingual TED task from IWSLT 2017.
https://wit3.fbk.eu/2017-01-b


#### Europarl

The training, dev, and test sets come from a subset of the Europarl corpus complied in the MMCR4NLP dataset (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.01025.pdf).

#### PMIndia

As the corpus (http://data.statmt.org/pmindia/) did not specify paritions of the train / dev / test sets, 
we partition the corpus ourselves.
After deduplicating, we first take a multiway subset of all languages, using English as pivot. 
This results in 1695 sentences in the dev and test respectively.
In this process, we excluded Assamese  (as),  Maithili  (mni),  Urdu  (ur). 
As these languages had very little data, including them would make the multiway subset too small. 

We upload our train/dev/test splits [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lxmqn_vJ4BDLjbtmKDHpF5gHxfDW33eW?usp=sharing).


## Experiment and Results
### Computation Infrastructure
All models were trained on Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080ti GPUs. 

### Average Runtime
All experiments were run with mixed-precision (optimization level "O1" from [apex](https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex)).

We train for 64 epochs by default.
The one exception is the Europarl-full case, 
where we also include the zero-shot directions in dev set for early stopping.

| Dataset                           | # sentences | Layers | Average Time Per Epoch |
|-----------------------------------|--------|--------|-----------------------| 
| IWSLT                             | 870K | 5 | 7 min   |
| Europarl (non-overlap / multiway) | 2M   | 8 | 45 min  |
| Europarl (full)                   | 17M  | 8 | 7 hr    |
| PMIndia                           | 639K | 5 | 9 min   |

### Number of Parameters
Note that although the models for IWSLT and PMIndia have the same depth, the vocabulary sizes differ. 
The final parameter count is therefore also different.

| Dataset   | Layers | # Parameters      |
|-----------|--------| ------------------|
| IWSLT     |  5     | 47M               |
| Europarl  |  8     | 79M               |
| PMIndia   |  5     | 58M               |

### Validation and Test Performance

We use `BLEU+case.mixed+numrefs.1+smooth.exp+tok.13a+version.1.4.12` by default. 

On the PMIndia dataset, we use the SPM tokenizer (`tok.spm` instead of `tok.13a`) for better tokenization of the Indic languages.
At the time of publication, the argument `tok.spm` is only available as a [pull request to sacreBLEU](https://github.com/mjpost/sacrebleu/pull/118). We applied the pull request locally to use the SPM tokenizer.

The average BLEU scores on the supervised directions are reported below 
in the format of: `dev / test`.

| Dataset   | Baseline | Residual | Residual + Query |
|-----------|----------|----------|---------|
| IWSLT                  | 27.6 / 29.8 ([model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/137YjxsZo5a1LGAfdzwjw8vbEokTc05N0/view?usp=sharing)) | 27.2 / 29.4 ([model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oeAfWg4yddNBuDJ8G7oD4p-TsYtxpGo0/view?usp=sharing)) | 27.4 / 29.4 |
| Europarl, multiway     | 34.6 / 34.2 | 34.2 / 33.9 | 34.8 / 33.1 |
| Europarl, non-overlap  | 36.0 / 35.6 | 35.7 / 35.4 | 35.3 / 34.9 |
| Europarl, full         | 35.9 / 35.4 | 35.6 / 36.4 | 36.0 / 35.9 |
| PMIndia                | 30.6 / 30.4 | 30.0 / 29.9 | 29.4 / 29.2 |
